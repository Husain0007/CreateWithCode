The official Unity course for Foundational Game Development.  
The course is available on the [Unity Learn Platform](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code).

Over the next few weeks I will be working to implement 5 Prototypes in the Unity Editor (v2018.4).  

The **first Prototype** is an obstacle course similar to my [Cubeathon](https://github.com/Husain0007/Cubeathon-with-Unity) project but with added high quality assets courtesy of [Synty Studios](https://www.syntystudios.com/)

In this prototype a car prefab takes in user inputs of angular rotation about the Y-axis and forward and backward motion using the arrow keys to navigate a track consisting of obstacles.

The **first Challenge** is to develop a prototype of a flight simulator. In this simulator a plane model can be rotated about the Pitch to navigate across a side-scrolling obstacle course.
As a *Bonus Challenge* the rotar should rotate about the Roll Axis of the plane.

The **second Prototype** teaches Basic Gameplay programming for a player in 2D space. The goal of this top-down prototype is to throw food at a stampede of animal prefabs charging at the player from random spawn locations in uniform succession.

The **second Challenge** makes use of user input to spawn canines that collect falling balls of different color. The challenge is to ensure the balls spawn at random locations along the Z-axis and that the player ins't able to spam the spawn key by ensuring a spawn only every 3 seconds.

The **third Prototype** is a fast-paced endless side-scrolling runner. The player needs to navigate around obstacle that appear in it's path. In this project I also add sound effects, particle effects, background music, and animation to simulate a prototype that is much closer to an actual launch ready mini-game than any of the previous prototypes.

The **third Challenge** is a fast-paced endless runner where the player is ballon with with up and down navigational control. The player ascends up or descends down to avoid bomb prefabs that randomly spawn throughout the playthrough. Coming in contact with the bombs lead to the end of the game followed by an explosion effect. The player also encounters rotation dollar prefabs which on contact trigger another animation and sound effect. The sound and animaiton assets for this prototpe were provided by Unity.

The **fourth Prototype** is a sumo battle arena where the player agent has to roll around on a hexagonal ring and avoid being knocked off by enemy agents. The player has access to powerups that temporarily allows the player to send oncoming enemy agents flying off the platform. After a single wave of enemies has been exhausted a new wave with an increased number of enemies spawns at random locations on the arena.

The **fourth Challenge** is to defend a goal post from oncoming enemy agents and score by knocking them into a goal post on the other side of the field. The player agent has the ability to boost and charge at the enemies for stronger hits, the player also get a power up with each new wave of enemies. The new wave consists of more enemies that move at a faster rate towards the players' goal post than the previous wave.
