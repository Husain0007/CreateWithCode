# Create With Code

The official Unity course for Foundational Game Development.  
The course is available on the [Unity Learn Platform](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code).

Over the next few weeks I will be working to implement 5 Prototypes in the Unity Editor (v2018.4).  

The first Prototype is an obstacle course similar to my [Cubeathon](https://github.com/Husain0007/Cubeathon-with-Unity) project but with added high quality assets courtesy of [Synty Studios](https://www.syntystudios.com/)
