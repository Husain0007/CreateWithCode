The official Unity course for Foundational Game Development.  
The course is available on the [Unity Learn Platform](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code).

Over the next few weeks I will be working to implement 5 Prototypes in the Unity Editor (v2018.4).  

The **first Prototype** is an obstacle course similar to my [Cubeathon](https://github.com/Husain0007/Cubeathon-with-Unity) project but with added high quality assets courtesy of [Synty Studios](https://www.syntystudios.com/)

In this prototype a car prefab takes in user inputs of angular rotation about the Y-axis and forward and backward motion using the arrow keys to navigate a track consisting of obstacles.

The **first Challenge** is to develop a prototype of a flight simulator. In this simulator a plane model can be rotated about the Pitch to navigate across a side-scrolling obstacle course.
